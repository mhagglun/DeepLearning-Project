## Description
This brain tumor dataset contains 3064 T1-weighted contrast-inhanced images
from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumor: meningioma (708 slices), 
glioma (1426 slices), and pituitary tumor (930 slices).

This data is organized in matlab data format (.mat file). Each file stores a struct
containing the following fields for an image:

* cjdata.label: 1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumor
* cjdata.PID: patient ID
* cjdata.image: image data
* cjdata.tumorBorder: a vector storing the coordinates of discrete points on tumor border.
		For example, [x1, y1, x2, y2,...] in which x1, y1 are planar coordinates on tumor border.
		It was generated by manually delineating the tumor border. So we can use it to generate
		binary image of tumor mask.
* cjdata.tumorMask: a binary image with 1s indicating tumor region
